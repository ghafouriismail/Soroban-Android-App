Overview
The Sorobanv1 application is an educational and entertaining Android app designed to help users practice basic arithmetic operations through a simple and interactive interface. Users are presented with random arithmetic problems of varying difficulty levels, and their goal is to input the correct answer to score points. The application keeps track of the user's score, encouraging continuous improvement and engagement.

Features
Random Arithmetic Problems: The app generates random addition, subtraction, and multiplication problems.
Difficulty Levels: Problems are categorized into three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
Score Tracking: The app keeps track of the user's score, which is displayed on the main screen.
User Interaction: Users can input their answers via a simple interface and validate their responses.
Feedback: The app provides immediate feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
Application Structure
Main Components

MainActivity: The main activity that handles the user interface and interaction.
Operation Interface: Defines the structure for different arithmetic operations.
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication Classes: Implementations of the Operation interface for different types of arithmetic operations.
Level Enum: Defines the difficulty levels for the operations.
Code Explanation
Operation Interface and Implementations

The Operation interface outlines the methods required for any arithmetic operation:

result(): Returns the result of the operation.
getOperationTemplate(): Returns a string template of the operation.
getLevel(): Returns the difficulty level of the operation.
The Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication classes implement this interface, providing specific logic for each operation.

MainActivity

The MainActivity class manages the app's main user interface:

UI Elements: It references various UI elements such as TextView for displaying operations, EditText for user input, and Button for user actions.
onCreate Method: Sets up the initial state of the app, including generating the first operation and setting up click listeners for buttons.
insertbutton Method: Handles the insertion of numbers into the answer input field.
Validation Logic: Checks the user's answer against the correct result, updates the score, and generates a new operation.
How to Use
Start the App: Launch the application on your Android device.
View the Operation: The main screen displays a randomly generated arithmetic operation.
Input Your Answer: Use the number buttons to input your answer into the provided field.
Validate Your Answer: Press the validate button to check if your answer is correct.
Feedback and Score Update: The app provides immediate feedback and updates your score accordingly. A new problem is generated for you to solve.
Clear Input: Use the delete button to clear your input if needed.
Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements to the app may include:

More Operations: Adding more types of arithmetic operations such as division.
Settings: Allowing users to select the difficulty level manually.
Timed Challenges: Introducing a timer to increase the challenge.
Leaderboard: Adding a leaderboard to track and compare scores with other users.
Conclusion
The Sorobanv1 app is a simple yet effective tool for practicing basic arithmetic operations. With its random problem generation and score tracking features, it provides a fun and educational experience for users of all ages.
